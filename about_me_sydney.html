             Hello, my name is Sydney Roberson and I am a junior Information Systems major <br>
             at The University of Missouri at St. Louis, from Chicago, IL. I enjoy going <br>
             to the movies with my friends and going to food festivals to try new foods. <br>
             I also enjoy coding, playing chess and basketball, and leaning new skills. <br>
             At the moment I am learning
